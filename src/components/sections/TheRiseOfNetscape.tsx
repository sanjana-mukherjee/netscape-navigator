            <p>
              By the mid-1990s, the internet was going mainstream. More people
              were coming online, and they needed a browser that was easy to use
              and fast.
            </p>
            <p>
              Netscape Navigator had the right mix of features. It was free for
              individuals and quickly became the{" "}
              <strong>most popular browser</strong>, especially on{" "}
              <strong>Windows</strong> computers.

            A Faster Web Experience
          </h3>
          <div className="text-justify max-w-prose flex flex-col gap-5 font-satoshi text-xl col-start-2 font-light">
            <p>In 1994, Netscape changed how people browsed the web.</p>
            <p>
              Before, web browsers waited for{" "}
              <strong>all graphics to load</strong> before showing anything.
              This meant users often stared at a blank screen for minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Netscape introduced <strong>on-the-fly page loading</strong>.
              Instead of waiting for everything to load at once, Navigator
              displayed text almost immediately while images continued to load
              in the background. This made browsing much faster and more
              seamless.

            New Features, New Challenges
          </h3>
          <div className="text-justify max-w-prose flex flex-col gap-5 font-satoshi text-xl col-start-2 font-light">
            <p>
              Through the late 1990s, Netscape continued to lead in innovation.
              It introduced <strong>cookies</strong>, which allowed websites to
              remember user preferences, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which
              enabled interactive web pages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although these features later became{" "}
              <strong>web standards</strong>, they were met with criticism. Some
              argued that Netscape prioritized shaping the web around its own
              technologies rather than adhering to established standards,
              sidelining competitors in the process. Others raised{" "}
              <strong>privacy concerns</strong> about cookies being used to
              track users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite these issues, Netscape remained the{" "}
              <strong>top web browser</strong> for a whileâ€”but competition was
              growing, and the <strong>browser wars</strong> were about to
              begin.
